Briefly, the core of the story was that a number of journalists, including respondent, were bent on publishing a series of articles critical of the applicant and its chairperson, Dr Iqbal Surve; that their main objective was to sabotage the applicant; that they undermined the reputation of a black-owned media business and its chairperson; that they were with all their articles against media transformation in its various facets.&nbsp; The article said, inter alia, that all these journalists belonged to a &ldquo;white boys&rsquo; club&rdquo;, and put into question their professional objectivity. [2]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his Ruling dated 28 September 2016, the Ombud summarized both the respondent&rsquo;s complaints, as well as the applicant&rsquo;s response.&nbsp; The complaint was related to the core of the article as set out above.&nbsp; In particular, that the respondent was not given the opportunity to respond; that she was labelled as being part of a &ldquo;white boys club&rdquo; and of being racist; that the allegations tarnished her professional reputation (she had been a journalist for at least 20 years); and that she was a plant of the Democratic Alliance. The respondent denied the allegations, and argued inter alia that the content of the article was&nbsp; the product of research. [3]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his Ruling, the Ombud dismissed some of the complaints; but found that the applicant had violated articles 1.1, 1.8 and 3.3 of the Press Code.&nbsp; The Ombud classified the violations as Tier 2, and ordered an apology, the substance and elements of which he prescribed. [4]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The applicant felt that the sanction was too severe in terms of the prescribed substance and elements; it argued that the transgression should be a Tier 1 transgression; hence this application for leave to appeal. [5]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before considering the application, one has to first deal with the preliminary objection raised by the respondent; namely, that the application is out of time.&nbsp; The applicant&rsquo;s explanation is that it spent some time trying to resolve the content and elements of the apology with the Ombud, only to find that he could not help as he was fuctus officio. I do not think that it was unreasonable of the applicant to first seek to resolve the matter, especially as it was not altogether refusing to publish an apology.&nbsp; I therefore grant the application for the condonation of the late noting of the application. [6]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In considering whether or not to grant leave to appeal, the applicant must show reasonable prospects of success before the Appeals Panel. I am of the view that the applicant has shown such prospects, taking into account inter alia the following: 6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The appeal is merely against the severity of the sanction, not really the merits as such. 6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The substance and elements of the apology to be published are based on certain findings by the Ombud which are arguable; and which, depending on the determination thereof, may affect the nature of the substance and elements of the sanction. As I am inclined to grant leave to appeal, it would not be appropriate for me to delve further into the matter. [7]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the reasons given above, the application succeeds and leave is granted to the applicant to appeal only against the severity of the sanction imposed by the Ombudsman in his Ruling of 28 September 2016.

Minority Decision Press Council of South Africa Minority Decision by Mahmood Sanglay on the Appeals Panel with Judge Bernard Ngoepe, and Neville Woudberg. Date of Appeals Panel Hearing: Wednesday 26 September 2016, Belmont Conference Centre, 9.00am Appellant: The Daily Voice, represented by Mr Terblanche Respondent: Shaun Westley, represented by Adv Bishop The ruling of the Press Ombud and the deliberations of the Appeals Panel [4]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority on the Appeals Panel upheld the appeal mainly because the headline and the contextualising sub-headline comply with article 10.1 which governs headlines. The Majority is of the view that reliance on articles 5.1 and 5.2 is &lsquo;misconceived&rsquo; and that such reliance creates &lsquo;an unnecessary contradiction&rsquo; between article 10.1 on the one hand, and articles 5.1 and 5.2 on the other. The Minority argument Reliance on &lsquo;contradictory&rsquo; articles [5]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minority agrees there is no breach of 10.1 of the code and therefore there is no dispute in this respect of the finding by the Majority. Quotation marks do not absolutely render its contents acceptable Breach of article 9.1 of the code Due care and responsibility shall be exercised by the media with regard to the presentation of brutality, gratuitous violence, and suffering: material which, judged within context, should not sanction, promote or glamorise violence or unlawful conduct, or discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation&hellip;&rsquo; The headline is therefore also in breach of 9.1 of the code. The headline with potential to both fight and to promote homophobia Preamble of the code: Express obligation to avoid unnecesary harm and to protect the vulnerable [24]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majority argues (para 6) that there was no &lsquo;obligation on Appellant to hide the truth, simply because the truth is ugly.&rsquo; The Minority concurs. However, according to the preamble of the code there is an obligation to avoid unnecessary harm and to show &lsquo;special concern for children and other vulnerable groups&rsquo;. There is thus an express obligation to balance reporting in the public interest with avoiding unnecessary harm and taking due care to protect this vulnerable group. [25]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The headline, as argued above, evidently does have the likely effect of compounding the indignity inflicted on homosexuals and of inciting further homophobic violence. Furthermore, the code reflects an express duty of care on the media to avoid unnecessary harm, particularly in respect of vulnerable groups. Therefore, the Minority submits that Respondent&rsquo;s obligation to avoid unnecessary harm and to show special concern for the protection of this vulnerable group should have been tested. Appealing to emotions Decision of the Minority [11]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minority is of the view that the appeal should be dismissed.

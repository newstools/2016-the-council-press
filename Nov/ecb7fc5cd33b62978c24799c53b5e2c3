[2]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The applicant raised a number of complaints, a number of which were dismissed by the Press Ombud.&nbsp; I will not go into them because this application is in respect of only two which were upheld by the Ombud, in consequence of which he imposed sanction on the applicant. [3]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In paragraph 2 of its application for leave to appeal, the applicant identifies the Ombud&rsquo;s findings in respect of which leave is sought as follows: &ldquo;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; News 24 seeks leave to appeal against the following findings (&ldquo;the main findings&rdquo;) by the press ombudsman: 2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That a news story entitled Gordhan orders Mashuta to cancel R378m IT tender was in breach of section 10.1 of the Code of Ethics and Conduct (&ldquo;the Code&rdquo;), in that News 24 wrongly stated that Gordhan had &lsquo;ordered&rsquo; Mashuta to cancel a contract. 2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That a column entitled Gordhan&rsquo;s R500 billion tender war was in breach of section 7.2.4 of the Code in that it should have mentioned that National Treasurery had in fact denied that Gordhan&rsquo;s letter to Mashuta constituted an order.&rdquo; Applicant says it seeks leave to appeal &ldquo;only in respect of the main findings listed in paragraph 2 above.&rdquo;&nbsp; Accordingly, I restrict myself to these two findings by the Ombud. [4]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not find any fault with the Ombud&rsquo;s reasons and finding that applicant &ldquo;wrongly stated that Gordhan had &lsquo;ordered&rsquo; Masutha to cancel a contract.&rdquo; &nbsp;I have noted what the applicant says in relation to what was argued or said in court or in the papers.&nbsp; I do not think that would detract from what an average reader would have understood, namely, that Gordhan ordered Masutha; this is a far cry from &ldquo;advising&rdquo;, which was in fact what Gordhan&rsquo;s letter said.&nbsp; The word &ldquo;order&rdquo; leaves no room for discretion, as opposed to an &ldquo;advice&rdquo;. Even if one were to accept that the Minister Gordhan &ldquo;ordered&rdquo; Minister Masutha, at best for the applicant the order would not have been to cancel, but for the latter to heed the facts and to consider the advice; it cannot have an order to cancel. [5]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding the R500 billion &ldquo;war&rdquo; finding, I again find no fault with the Ombud&rsquo;s finding. It was incumbent on the applicant to mention that National Treasury had denied that Gordhan&rsquo;s letter to Masutha amounted to an order.&nbsp; No elaboration is needed. [6]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In light of what is said above, I see no reasonable prospects of success for the applicant before the Appeals Panel; that being the case, the application is dismissed.
